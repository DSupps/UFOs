# UFOs

## Challenge Overview:
*The challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings data by allowing users to filter by multiple criteria.  The data is difficult to analyze when viewing it in its complete form on the webpage.  Adding multiple filtering criteria will allow the user to narrow down their search results.  To accomplish this, additional filters for the city, state, country, and shape will need to be created using JavaScript, HTML, and bootstrap.  The end result will be a dynamic webpage with UFO sighting data that user can narrow down to their specific search criteria.*

### What I'm creating:
1. Deliverable 1: Filter UFO Sightings on multiple criteria
2. Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis

### Resources:
- Data Sources: UFO sighting data provided

- Software:
    - Python 3.8.5
    - MacOs Catalina Version 10.16.7
    - Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
    - Visual Studio Code 1.57.1
    - BootStrap 4.4
   
## Challenge Results:
The index landing page is interactive with the ability to filter search results by date, city, state, country, and shape. The user can choose one up to all five filters at once.

### Filter by date:
The user can filter by event date they choose. In the box underneath "Enter Date", the user can input any date available in the data and just the events recorded on that date will display. In the example shown, the user selected the date of 1/13/2010.

### Filter by city:
The user can filter by city they choose.  In the box underneath "Enter the City", the user can input any city available in the data city and just the events that occurred in that city will display. Here the user has chosen the city of Port St.Lucie.

### Filter by state:

## Challenge Summary:
The UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy? is now a dynamic webpage that provides users with data about UFO sightings and the ability to create specific search criteria if they so choose.  To get back to the default filter search, all the user has to do is clear the search criteria and hit return or refresh the page. 

However, there is one drawback to the site.  The user must know the exact filter search text formats to pull up the data they are looking for. If the wrong format is used the table will not display the specific data the user is looking for.
